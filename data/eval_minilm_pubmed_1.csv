Is b lymphopenia in uremia related to an accelerated in vitro apoptosis and dysregulation of Bcl-2?,"['Lymphopenia has been described in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). It is postulated that the decline in lymphocytes is due to accelerated apoptosis. We investigated whether dysregulation of programmed cell death plays a role in the immunodeficiency described in CRF. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from pre-dialysis uraemic patients (nHD) and haemodialysed patients (HD) were cultured with no stimulus for 96 h. Apoptosis of lymphocytes was measured by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Expression of Fas and Bcl-2 was also analysed by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood B cells were significantly lower in pre-dialysis and haemodialysis uraemic patients compared to control. Lymphocytes from both groups of patients had a higher rate of apoptosis in vitro than those from healthy controls. This effect was more pronounced in B lymphocytes and a significant correlation between the B lymphopenia and the percentage of apoptotic B cells after 48 h of culture without stimulus was observed. The increased lymphocyte apoptosis in CRF was accompanied by a significantly lower in vitro Bcl-2 expression. However, Fas did not seem to play a role in spontaneous lymphocyte apoptosis in end-stage renal disease.']",Our data indicate that B lymphopenia in CRF may be partially attributed to an increased susceptibility to cell death by apoptosis that is associated with a decreased expression of Bcl-2.," Yes, the context suggests that B lymphopenia in uremia is related to an accelerated in vitro apoptosis and a dysregulation of Bcl-2. This is based on observations showing higher rates of apoptosis in B lymphocytes from both pre-dialysis and haemodialysis patients with uremia compared to healthy controls, as well as significantly lower in vitro Bcl-2 expression in these patient groups.",1.0,1.0,0.5861093997955322
Does obstructive sleep apnea syndrome increase pedestrian injury risk in children?,"['To evaluate pedestrian behavior, including reaction time, impulsivity, risk-taking, attention, and decision-making, in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) compared with healthy controls. Using a case control design, 8- to 16-year-olds (n = 60) with newly diagnosed and untreated OSAS engaged in a virtual reality pedestrian environment. Sixty-one healthy children matched using a yoke-control procedure by age, race, sex, and household income served as controls. Children with OSAS were riskier pedestrians than healthy children of the same age, race, and sex. Children with OSAS waited less time to cross (P < .01). The groups did not differ in looking at oncoming traffic or taking longer to decide to cross.']","Results suggest OSAS may have significant consequences on children's daytime functioning in a critical domain of personal safety, pedestrian skills. Children with OSAS appeared to have greater impulsivity when crossing streets. Results highlight the need for heightened awareness of the consequences of untreated sleep disorders and identify a possible target for pediatric injury prevention."," Yes, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) are riskier pedestrians than healthy children of the same age, race, and sex. This increased risk is reflected in a shorter waiting time to cross roads in a virtual reality environment. However, it's important to note that this study only demonstrates an association, not causation. More research would be needed to determine if OSAS directly increases the risk of pedestrian injuries in children.",1.0,0.5,0.7403859496116638
Do spinal manipulation force and duration affect vertebral movement and neuromuscular responses?,"['Previous study in human subjects has documented biomechanical and neurophysiological responses to impulsive spinal manipulative thrusts, but very little is known about the neuromechanical effects of varying thrust force-time profiles. Ten adolescent Merino sheep were anesthetized and posteroanterior mechanical thrusts were applied to the L3 spinous process using a computer-controlled, mechanical testing apparatus. Three variable pulse durations (10, 100, 200 ms, force = 80 N) and three variable force amplitudes (20, 40, 60 N, pulse duration = 100 ms) were examined for their effect on lumbar motion response (L3 displacement, L1, L2 acceleration) and normalized multifidus electromyographic response (L3, L4) using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Increasing L3 posteroanterior force amplitude resulted in a fourfold linear increase in L3 posteroanterior vertebral displacement (p < 0.001) and adjacent segment (L1, L2) posteroanterior acceleration response (p < 0.001). L3 displacement was linearly correlated (p < 0.001) to the acceleration response over the 20-80 N force range (100 ms). At constant force, 10 ms thrusts resulted in nearly fivefold lower L3 displacements and significantly increased segmental (L2) acceleration responses compared to the 100 ms (19%, p = 0.005) and 200 ms (16%, p = 0.023) thrusts. Normalized electromyographic responses increased linearly with increasing force amplitude at higher amplitudes and were appreciably affected by mechanical excitation pulse duration.']",Changes in the biomechanical and neuromuscular response of the ovine lumbar spine were observed in response to changes in the force-time characteristics of the spinal manipulative thrusts and may be an underlying mechanism in related clinical outcomes.," Yes, the study provided suggests that both spinal manipulation force and duration can have significant effects on vertebral movement (L3 displacement) and neuromuscular responses (normalized electromyographic response). Increasing force amplitude resulted in a greater L3 displacement, while shorter pulse durations resulted in lower L3 displacements compared to longer ones. The electromyographic responses increased with increasing force amplitude and were affected by the mechanical excitation pulse duration.",1.0,1.0,0.6878900527954102
Does polymyxin B prevent increased sympathetic activity and alveolar macrophage tumor necrosis factor release in parenterally fed rats?,"['To determine the effects of polymyxin B sulfate in rats fed by total parenteral nutrition on norepinephrine excretion, macrophage tumor necrosis factor production, and bacterial translocation. Randomized animal study. A university teaching hospital in Seattle, Wash. Three groups of rats were studied: chow plus intravenous saline, total parenteral nutrition, or total parenteral nutrition supplemented with polymyxin B sulfate. After 5 days, urinary excretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine was calculated, peritoneal and alveolar macrophages were cultured, and their spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor production was measured. Mesenteric lymph nodes were cultured for bacteria. Rats fed by total parenteral nutrition had increased urine norepinephrine excretion (33%) and alveolar macrophage tumor necrosis factor production (80%) and trends for increased epinephrine excretion and bacterial translocation compared with rats fed chow. Alveolar but not peritoneal macrophage tumor necrosis factor production was significantly related to norepinephrine excretion (r = .5, P < .01). The addition of polymyxin B to total parenteral nutrition decreased weight gain (P < .05), urinary norepinephrine excretion (P < .01), and alveolar macrophage tumor necrosis factor production (P < .05) compared with rats fed by total parenteral nutrition. Polymyxin B also tended to decrease the magnitude of bacterial translocation.']",Alveolar macrophage tumor necrosis factor production appears to be influenced by sympathetic nervous activity. Total parenteral nutrition-induced endotoxemia may indirectly alter macrophage function by stimulating sympathetic nervous activity.," Yes, according to the provided context, the addition of polymyxin B to total parenteral nutrition decreased urinary norepinephrine excretion (a marker of sympathetic activity) and alveolar macrophage tumor necrosis factor production in parenterally fed rats.",1.0,1.0,0.7075549364089966
Is better life expectancy in women with BRCA2 compared with BRCA1 mutations attributable to lower frequency and later onset of ovarian cancer?,"['No formal assessment of life expectancy in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in these genes has been reported previously. We have evaluated life expectancy using actuarial analysis and assessed the effect of breast and ovarian cancers on premature death in >1,000 BRCA1/2 carriers. Families with pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been ascertained in a 10-million population region of United Kingdom since 1996. Mutation carriers and their first-degree relatives were used in an analysis of breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality as well as to derive and compare an actuarial assessment of life expectancy. Six hundred twelve BRCA1 and 482 BRCA2 female mutation carriers were identified from 482 families. Life expectancy was significantly reduced for BRCA1 carriers compared with BRCA2 (P = 0.0002). This effect was attributable to an increased death rate from ovarian cancer (P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a better long-term survival from early-stage ovarian cancer in BRCA2 carriers but no significant differences in deaths from breast cancer or from women presenting with late-stage ovarian cancer. There was no other major contributing cause to death other than breast/ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 female carriers.']",Interventions to reduce ovarian cancer incidence are likely to have a greater effect on life expectancy in BRCA1 compared with BRCA2 carriers.," The provided context suggests that the lower frequency and later onset of ovarian cancer in BRCA2 carriers may contribute to a better life expectancy compared to BRCA1 carriers. However, it does not definitively state that this difference is solely due to lower frequencies and later onset of ovarian cancer. Other factors such as breast cancer incidence, family history, and treatment could also play a role in the observed differences. Therefore, while it's reasonable to assume that a lower frequency and later onset of ovarian cancer might contribute to better life expectancy, more research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis and isolate specific contributing factors.",1.0,1.0,0.7844420075416565
Does cognitive executive performance influence functional outcome in euthymic type I bipolar disorder outpatients?,"['There is a debate about the influence of executive functioning impairment in the functionality of Bipolar Disorder Type I, even when euthymic (EutBDI). The aim of this study was to explore this relationship, taking functional outcome from a multidimensional point of view. An extended neuropsychological battery of executive tests and measures of social functioning were administered to 31 EutBDI and 25 non-psychiatric patients. Percentage of patients scoring lower than -1.64 SD was calculated for each executive measure. This was compared in terms of clinical features to those with normal performance. Partial correlations and ANCOVA were applied between psychosocial and executive variables within the EutBDI-group. Patients reached poorer scores in mental flexibility, plan implementing, set-shifting, and fluency (p<0.05). 76% of patients performed poorly on some of the executive tests, although only around 1/3 reached a clinical deficit (<-1.64SD). Executive functioning was related to some clinical, evolution, and treatment variables. A better use of leisure time, higher competence for independent living and holding a skilled type of profession were significantly associated with a better performance on planning, set-shifting, and fluency tasks.']",Persistent executive deficits in EutBDI may be related to their frequently reported difficulties in personaland occupational adjustment.," Yes, cognitive executive performance does seem to influence functional outcome in euthymic Type I bipolar disorder outpatients. The study indicates that patients with Bipolar Disorder Type I performed poorer on tasks related to mental flexibility, plan implementing, set-shifting, and fluency compared to non-psychiatric patients.

Does angiotensin AT2 receptor stimulation cause neuroprotection in a conscious rat model of stroke?,"['The angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) is implicated to be neuroprotective in stroke, although this premise has not been directly tested. Therefore, we have examined the neuroprotective effect of AT(2)R stimulation after intracerebroventricular administration of AT(2)R agonist CGP42112 in a conscious rat model of stroke. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with either CGP42112 (0.1 to 10 ng/kg/min intracerebroventricularly) alone or in combination with the AT(2)R antagonist PD123319 (36 ng/kg/min intracerebroventricularly) beginning 5 days before stroke induction. A focal reperfusion model of stroke was induced in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats by administering endothelin-1 to the middle cerebral artery through a surgically implanted cannula. Behavioral tests were used to assess the severity of neurological deficit as a result of the ischemic event. Cortical and striatal infarct volumes were measured 72 hours poststroke.

Does spent culture medium from virulent Borrelia burgdorferi increase permeability of individually perfused microvessels of rat mesentery?,"['Lyme disease is a common vector-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which manifests as systemic and targeted tissue inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Bb-induced inflammation is primarily host-mediated, via cytokine or chemokine production that promotes leukocyte adhesion/migration. Whether Bb produces mediators that can directly alter the vascular permeability in vivo has not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate if Bb produces a mediator(s) that can directly activate endothelial cells resulting in increases in permeability in intact microvessels in the absence of blood cells. The effects of cell-free, spent culture medium from virulent (B31-A3) and avirulent (B31-A) B. burgdorferi on microvessel permeability and endothelial calcium concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), were examined in individually perfused rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca(2+)](i), a necessary signal initiating hyperpermeability, was measured in Fura-2 loaded microvessels. B31-A3 spent medium caused a rapid and transient increase in Lp and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). Within 2-5 min, the mean peak Lp increased to 5.6+/-0.9 times the control, and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) increased from 113+/-11 nM to a mean peak value of 324+/-35 nM. In contrast, neither endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) nor Lp was altered by B31-A spent medium.']","A mediator(s) produced by virulent Bb under culture conditions directly activates endothelial cells, resulting in increases in microvessel permeability. Most importantly, the production of this mediator is associated with Bb virulence and is likely produced by one or more of the 8 plasmid(s) missing from strain B31-A."," Yes, spent culture medium from virulent Borrelia burgdorferi (B31-A3) does increase the permeability of individually perfused microvessels in rat mesentery.",1.0,1.0,0.5330570340156555

Does vagus Nerve Stimulation During Rehabilitative Training improve Forelimb Recovery After Chronic Ischemic Stroke in Rats?,"['Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability. Currently, there are no consistently effective rehabilitative treatments for chronic stroke patients. Our recent studies demonstrate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitative training improves recovery of function in multiple models of stroke. Here, we evaluated the ability of VNS paired with rehabilitative training to improve recovery of forelimb strength when initiated many weeks after a cortical and subcortical ischemic lesion in subjects with stable, chronic motor deficits. Rats were trained to perform an automated, quantitative measure of voluntary forelimb strength. Once proficient, rats received injections of endothelin-1 to cause a unilateral cortical and subcortical ischemic lesion. Then, 6 weeks after the lesion, rats underwent rehabilitative training paired with VNS (Paired VNS; n = 10), rehabilitative training with equivalent VNS delivered 2 hours after daily rehabilitative training (Delayed VNS; n = 10), or rehabilitative training without VNS (Rehab, n = 9). VNS paired with rehabilitative training significantly improved recovery of forelimb function compared with control groups.

Is an increased arginase activity associated with corpus cavernosum impairment induced by hypercholesterolemia?,"['Hypercholesterolemia is a prevalent risk factor for the development of erectile dysfunction (ED), mostly due to an increase in oxidative stress and impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability within the penis. Arginase is an enzyme that shares the common substrate L-arginine with NO synthase. Augmented arginase activity reduces NO production and is associated with ED development. However, the contribution of arginase hyperactivity in hypercholesterolemia-induced ED is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the activity and role of arginase in the corpus cavernosum of hypercholesterolemic mice. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene-deleted mice fed with a Western-type diet for 11 weeks were treated with the selective arginase inhibitor, N-ω-Hydroxy-L-norarginine (NOHA), or vehicle (saline 0.9%) during the last 9 weeks. Arginase activity and expression were measured in penis protein extraction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content within the corpus cavernosum was measured by dihydroethidium staining. Functional in vitro studies were performed using cavernosal strips mounted in an isometric organ bath to evaluate NO production. Arginase activity and its role in modulating NO and ROS production within the corpus cavernosum of hypercholesterolemic mice is the main outcome measure. Total arginase activity and arginase type II protein expression were increased in hypercholesterolemic mice compared with wild-type mice. The long-term treatment with NOHA normalized this alteration. Moreover, pharmacological arginase inhibition by NOHA attenuated the augmented ROS production within the corpus cavernosum of ApoE(-/-) mice, which increased the NO-dependent response in cavernosal strips.']","These evidences indicate that arginase hyperactivity is associated with ED induced by hypercholesterolemia, suggesting that this enzyme is a potential target for treating ED."," Yes, increased arginase activity is associated with corpus cavernosum impairment induced by hypercholesterolemia.

Is sUMOylation of the α-kleisin subunit of cohesin required for DNA damage-induced cohesion?,"[""Cohesion between sister chromatids is fundamental to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis and accurate repair of DNA damage postreplication. At the molecular level, cohesion establishment involves two defined events, a chromatin binding step and a chromatid entrapment event driven by posttranslational modifications on cohesin subunits. Here, we show that modification by the small ubiquitin-like protein (SUMO) is required for sister chromatid tethering after DNA damage. We find that all subunits of cohesin become SUMOylated upon exposure to DNA damaging agents or presence of a DNA double-strand break. We have mapped all lysine residues on cohesin's α-kleisin subunit Mcd1 (Scc1) where SUMO can conjugate. We demonstrate that Mcd1 SUMOylation-deficient alleles are still recruited to DSB-proximal regions but are defective in tethering sister chromatids and consequently fail to establish damage-induced cohesion both at DSBs and undamaged chromosomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the bulk of Mcd1 SUMOylation in response to damage is carried out by the SUMO E3 ligase Nse2, a subunit of the related Smc5-Smc6 complex.

Do hepatotoxin-induced changes in the adult murine liver promote MYC-induced tumorigenesis?,"['Overexpression of the human c-MYC (MYC) oncogene is one of the most frequently implicated events in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previously, we have shown in a conditional transgenic mouse model that MYC overexpression is restrained from inducing mitotic cellular division and tumorigenesis in the adult liver; whereas, in marked contrast, MYC induces robust proliferation associated with the very rapid onset of tumorigenesis in embryonic and neonatal mice. Here, we show that non-genotoxic hepatotoxins induce changes in the liver cellular context associated with increased cellular proliferation and enhanced tumorigenesis. Both 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) cooperate with MYC to greatly accelerate the onset of liver cancer in an adult host to less than 7 days versus a mean latency of onset of over 35 weeks for MYC alone. These hepatotoxin-enhanced liver tumors grossly and histologically resemble embryonic and neonatal liver tumors. Importantly, we found that MYC overexpression is only capable of inducing expression of the mitotic Cyclin B1 in embryonic/neonatal hosts or adult hosts that were treated with either carcinogen.']","Our results suggest a model whereby oncogenes can remain latently activated, but exposure of the adult liver to hepatotoxins that promote hepatocyte proliferation can rapidly uncover their malignant potential."," Yes, hepatotoxin-induced changes in the adult murine liver appear to promote MYC-induced tumorigenesis.

Is adiponectin in umbilical cord blood inversely related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but not ethnicity?,"[""Adiponectin is a recognized protective risk marker for cardiovascular disease in adults and is associated with an optimal lipid profile. The role of adiponectin at birth is not well understood, and its relationship with the neonatal lipid profile is unknown. Because ethnic disparities in cardiovascular risk have been attributed to low adiponectin and its associated low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), investigation at birth may help determine the etiology of these risk patterns. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between neonatal adiponectin and lipid profile at birth in two ethnic groups in cord blood. Seventy-four healthy mothers and their newborns of South Asian and White European origin were studied in this cross-sectional study at St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom. Serum adiponectin, total cholesterol, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride levels were measured in umbilical venous blood at birth and in maternal blood collected at 28 wk gestation. Cord adiponectin was significantly inversely associated with cord LDL-C (r = -0.32; P = 0.005) but not HDL-C. In a multiple regression analysis, cord LDL-C remained the most significant association of cord adiponectin (beta = -0.13; P < 0.001).

Is a trabecular plate-like phenotype overrepresented in Chinese-American versus Caucasian women?,"['This study used extreme phenotype selection to define two trabecular bone phenotypes in a cohort of Chinese-American and Caucasian women. A trabecular plate-predominant phenotype is more common in Chinese-Americans while the rod-predominant phenotype is more typical of Caucasians. The robustness of these phenotypic associations with respect to lifestyle factors suggests that this trait may have a genetic basis and that these phenotypes can be utilized in future genetic studies. Compared to Caucasians, Chinese-Americans have more plate-like trabecular bone when measured by individual trabecula segmentation (ITS). These findings suggest a phenotypic difference between the races, which may be amenable to genetic analysis. We sought to identify a single ITS plate trait to pursue in genetic studies by conducting an extreme phenotype selection strategy to numerically define two distinct phenotypes-plate-like and rod-like-and determine whether the selected phenotypic associations were independent of lifestyle factors in order to conduct future genetic studies. A previously described cohort of 146 Chinese-American and Caucasian women with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography imaging and ITS analyses were studied with logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic analyses. The tibial plate-to-rod (TPR) ratio was the best ITS discriminator of race. Using extreme phenotypic selection, two TPR ratio phenotypes were defined numerically: plate-like as a TPR ratio value in the highest quartile (≥1.336) and rod-like as a TPR ratio value in the lowest quartile (≤0.621). Women with a plate-like phenotype were 25.7 times more likely (95 % CI 7.3-90.1) to be Chinese-American than women with rod-like morphology.

Are preoperative white matter lesions independent predictors of long-term survival after internal carotid endarterectomy?,"[""Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) predict long-term survival of conservatively treated acute stroke patients with etiology other than carotid stenosis. In carotid endarterectomy patients, WMLs are associated with severe carotid stenosis and unstable plaques, with the risk of perioperative complications and with increased 30-day perioperative risk of death. However, no data exist on their effect on postoperative long-term survival, a factor important when considering the net benefit from carotid endarterectomy. Whether this effect is independent of classical risk factors and indications for surgery is not known either.

Does computer simulation of lumbar flexion show shear of the facet capsular ligament?,"['The lumbar facet capsular ligament (FCL) is a posterior spinal ligament with a complex structure and kinematic profile. The FCL has a curved geometry, multiple attachment sites, and preferentially aligned collagen fiber bundles on the posterior surface that are innervated with mechanoreceptive nerve endings. Spinal flexion induces three-dimensional (3D) deformations, requiring the FCL to maintain significant tensile and shear loads. Previous works aimed to study 3D facet joint kinematics during flexion, but to our knowledge none have reported localized FCL surface deformations likely created by this complex structure. The purpose of this study was to elucidate local deformations of both the posterior and anterior surfaces of the lumbar FCL to understand the distribution and magnitude of in-plane and through-plane deformations, including the prevalence of shear. The FCL anterior and posterior surface deformations were quantified through creation of a finite element model simulating facet joint flexion using a realistic geometry, physiological kinematics, and fitted constitutive material. Geometry was obtained from the micro-CT data of a healthy L3-L4 facet joint capsule (n=1); kinematics were extracted from sagittal plane fluoroscopic data of healthy volunteers (n=10) performing flexion; and average material properties were determined from planar biaxial extension tests of L4-L5 FCLs (n=6). All analyses were performed with the non-linear finite element solver, FEBio. A grid of equally spaced 3×3 nodes on the posterior surface identified regional differences within the strain fields and was used to create comparisons against previously published experimental data. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the authors have no disclosures. Inhomogeneous in-plane and through-plane shear deformations were prominent through the middle body of the FCL on both surfaces. Anterior surface deformations were more pronounced because of the small width of the joint space, whereas posterior surface deformations were more diffuse because the larger area increased deformability. We speculate these areas of large deformation may provide this proprioceptive system with an excellent measure of spinal motion.']","We found that in-plane and through-plane shear deformations are widely present in finite element simulations of a lumbar FCL during flexion. Importantly, we conclude that future studies of the FCL must consider the effects of both shear and tensile deformations."," Yes, according to the provided context, computer simulation of lumbar flexion shows significant inhomogeneous in-plane and through-plane shear deformations on both surfaces of the lumbar facet capsular ligament (FCL).",1.0,1.0,0.8050516247749329

Does increasing functional variability in the preparatory phase of the takeoff improve elite springboard diving performance?,"[""Previous research demonstrating that specific performance outcome goals can be achieved in different ways is functionally significant for springboard divers whose performance environment can vary extensively. This body of work raises questions about the traditional approach of balking (terminating the takeoff) by elite divers aiming to perform only identical, invariant movement patterns during practice. A 12-week training program (2 times per day; 6.5 hr per day) was implemented with 4 elite female springboard divers to encourage them to adapt movement patterns under variable takeoff conditions and complete intended dives, rather than balk. Intraindividual analyses revealed small increases in variability in the board-work component of each diver's pretraining and posttraining program reverse-dive takeoffs.

Does carvacrol alleviate ischemia reperfusion injury by regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway in rats?,"['Liver ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathophysiological process in many clinical settings. Carvacrol, a food additive commonly used in essential oils, has displayed antimicrobials, antitumor and antidepressant-like activities. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of carvacrol on I/R injury in the Wistar rat livers and an in vitro hypoxia/restoration (H/R) model. The hepatoportal vein, hepatic arterial and hepatic duct of Wistar rats were isolated and clamped for 30 min, followed by a 2 h reperfusion. Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells were incubated under hypoxia for 4 h, followed normoxic conditions for 10 h to establish the H/R model in vitro. Liver injury was evaluated by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspatate aminotransferase (AST), and hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondiadehyde (MDA), and hepatic histology and TUNEL staining. MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis of BRL cells in vitro. Protein expression was examined by Western Blot analysis. Carvacrol protected against I/R-induced liver damage, evidenced by significantly reducing the serum levels of ALT and AST, histological alterations and apoptosis of liver cells in I/R rats. Carvacrol exhibited anti-oxidative activity in the I/R rats, reflected by significantly reducing the activity of SOD and the content of MDA, and restoring the activity of CAT and the content of GSH, in I/R rats. In the in vitro assays, carvacrol restored the viability and inhibited the apoptosis of BRL cells, which were subjected to a mimic I/R injury induced by hypoxia. In the investigation on molecular mechanisms, carvacrol downregulated the expression of Bax and upregulated the expression of Bcl-2, thus inhibited the activation of caspase-3. Carvacrol was also shown to enhance the phosphorylation of Akt.']","The results suggest that carvacrol could alleviate I/R-induced liver injury by its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities, and warrant a further investigation for using carvacrol to protect I/R injury in clinic."," Yes, according to the provided context, Carvacrol does appear to alleviate ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury at least partially by regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway in rats. In the liver I/R model, carvacrol inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt. In the hypoxic preconditioning (PC) study, PC restored the levels of p-Akt and the Akt substrate GSK-3beta, suggesting the involvement of the PI3K-Akt pathway in PC-induced neuroprotection against ischemia-induced brain injury. However, it's important to note that while the data suggests a role for the PI3K-Akt pathway, it doesn't definitively prove that this is the only or primary mechanism by which carvacrol exerts its protective effects against I/R injury in rats. Further studies are needed to confirm and elucidate the precise mechanisms of action of carvacol in this context.",1.0,1.0,0.7230182886123657
Is tumor necrosis factor-α expression in patients with obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia associated with a higher incidence of asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis NIH category IV and prostatic calcification?,"[""The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) with asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis National Institutes of Health (NIH) category IV and prostatic calculi, in patients with obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated by transurethral electroresection of the prostate (TURP).  Ninety-six patients with obstructive BPH and TURP were evaluated in a prospective study. Based on a preoperative transrectal ultrasound examination of the prostate gland, patients were divided into two groups, one with prostatic calculi (n = 31) and one without (n = 65). Prostatitis NIH category IV was classified according to Irani's histological grading system (Irani et al. J Urol 1997;157:1301-3).

Is down-Regulation of microRNA-132 Associated with Poor Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer?,"['Given the role of microRNA in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, we explored the association between microRNA (miRNA) expression and CRC-related prognosis. Three types of tissue samples (primary CRC lesions without liver metastasis, primary lesions with liver metastasis, and liver metastatic tissues) were used for miRNA profiling to identify differentially expressed miRNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine miRNA expression in CRC cells and in tumor tissues. MiR-132 was significantly down-regulated in primary CRC tissues with liver metastasis and liver metastatic lesions compared to primary lesions without liver metastasis. Multivariate analysis for overall survival indicated that low miR-132 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (overall survival P\xa0=\xa00.040, disease-free survival P\xa0=\xa00.015). Ectopic expression of miR-132 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and cell invasion. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that anoctamin 1 (ANO1) was a direct target of miR-132. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high ANO1 expression was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival of patients with CRC (P\xa0=\xa00.0344).']",Down-regulation of miR-132 is associated with poor prognosis in CRC.

Do cannabinoid type 1 receptors in human skeletal muscle cells participate in the negative crosstalk between fat and muscle?,"['Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) antagonists such as rimonabant (Rim) represent a novel approach to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders. Recent data suggest that endocannabinoids are also produced by human adipocytes. Here we studied the potential involvement of endocannabinoids in the negative crosstalk between fat and muscle. The protein level of CB1R in human skeletal muscle cells (SkM) during differentiation was analysed using western blotting. SkM were treated with adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) or anandamide (AEA) in combination with the CB1R antagonists Rim or AM251, and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake were determined. Furthermore, signalling pathways of CB1R were investigated. We revealed an increase of CB1R protein in SkM during differentiation. Twenty-four hour incubation of SkM with CM or AEA impaired insulin-stimulated Akt(Ser473) phosphorylation by 60% and up to 40%, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with Rim or AM251 reduced the effect of CM by about one-half, while the effect of AEA could be prevented completely. The reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by CM was completely prevented by Rim. Short-time incubation with AEA activated extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and impaired insulin-stimulated Akt(Ser473) phosphorylation, but had no effect on Akt(Thr308) and glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta phosphorylation. In addition, enhanced IRS-1 (Ser307) phosphorylation was observed.']","Our results show that the CB1R system may play a role in the development of insulin resistance in human SkM. The results obtained with CM support the notion that adipocytes may secrete factors which are able to activate the CB1R. Furthermore, we identified two stress kinases in the signalling pathway of AEA and enhanced IRS-1(Ser307) phosphorylation, potentially underlying the development of insulin resistance."," Yes, based on the provided context, it is suggested that cannabinoid type 1 receptors in human skeletal muscle cells do participate in the negative crosstalk between fat and muscle. This conclusion is drawn from the results showing an increase of CB1R protein in differentiating skeletal muscle cells, as well as the impact of adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) or anandamide (AEA) on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake in these cells.

Does maternal high-fat hypercaloric diet during pregnancy result in persistent metabolic and respiratory abnormalities in offspring?,"[""We have shown in a previous population-based study significant correlation between childhood asthma and early abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism. This study's specific aim was to determine whether maternal nutrition in pregnancy affects postnatal metabolic and respiratory outcomes in the offspring. On gestation day 1, dams were switched from standard chow to either high-fat hypercaloric diet or control diet. Terminal experiments were performed on newborn and weanling offspring of dams fed the study diet during gestation and lactation, and on adult offspring maintained on the same diet as their mother. Pups born from high-fat hypercaloric diet (HFD) dams developed metabolic abnormalities persistent throughout development. Cytokine expression analysis of lung tissues from newborns born to HFD dams revealed a strong proinflammatory pattern. Gene expression of neurotrophic factors and receptors was upregulated in lungs of weanlings born to HFD dams, and this was associated to higher respiratory system resistance and lower compliance at baseline, as well as hyperreactivity to aerosolized methacholine. Furthermore, HFD dams delivered pups prone to develop more severe disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.""]",Maternal nutrition in pregnancy is a critical determinant of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in offspring and also increases risk for bronchiolitis independent from prepregnancy nutrition.," Yes, based on the context provided, a maternal high-fat hypercaloric diet during pregnancy results in persistent metabolic abnormalities throughout development in the offspring.

Does preservation of the rectus femoris origin during periacetabular osteotomy compromise acetabular reorientation?,"[""The early recovery period after periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) can be limited by pain and activity restrictions. Modifications of the Bernese PAO, including sparing the rectus tendon and discontinuing routine arthrotomy, may accelerate early postoperative recovery compared with the standard approach. Does a modified approach for PAO (1) lead to improved pain control immediately after surgery; (2) lead to improved ambulation during the hospital stay; (3) lead to shorter stays, less blood loss, and shorter surgical times; and (4) compromise acetabular correction? We retrospectively reviewed all 75 patients who underwent PAO for developmental dysplasia of the hip between August 2009 and May 2013. The control group included 44 consecutive patients who underwent a standard Bernese PAO with rectus takedown (RT). The study group consisted of 31 consecutive patients who underwent PAO using a modified rectus-sparing (RS) approach without routine arthrotomy. The groups were similar in age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score, but the RT group was comprised of a greater percentage of men than the RS group. Outcome variables were collected from patient charts and included inpatient pain, inpatient ambulation as well as length of stay, estimated blood loss, surgical time, and postoperative radiographic measurements. Cohen's f(2) was used to calculate the effect size in the regression analysis and effects were considered small for values<0.15, moderate for 0.15 to 0.34, and large for values>0.35. Patients who underwent PAO with a RS approach had less overall pain (RT median 4 versus RS median 2); however, the difference may not have been perceptible to the typical patient (p=0.001, f2=0.059). Patients treated with the RS approach ambulated similar distances during the hospital stay with a median 11 feet (interquartile range [IQR], 0-72.5) for the RT group and a median 30 feet (IQR, 0-100) for the RS group (p=0.215, f2=0.095). Patients in the RT group had a median length of stay of 4 days (IQR, 4-5) compared with a median 3 days (IQR, 3-4) in the RS group (p<0.001). The median estimated blood loss was greater (p=0.010) in the RT group (median, 500 mL; IQR, 350-700) versus the RS group (median, 300; IQR, 250-500). The median surgical time was longer (p<0.001) in patients undergoing PAO with the RT approach (median, 159.5 minutes; IQR, 145.5-177) compared with the RS approach (median, 103 minutes; IQR, 75-114). Acetabular reorientation based on postoperative radiographs was not compromised by the modified approach.""]","The approach modification was straightforward to implement in all patients and did not compromise acetabular fragment mobilization or final positioning. Two of the three key variables that the approach might have influenced-pain and length of stay-were below the minimum clinically important difference and different by only a fraction of a day, respectively. The difference in ambulation was of only modest clinical importance. More definitive evidence for clinical superiority in terms of pain, ambulation, and return of muscle function will likely require more sophisticated instruments such as gait analysis, muscle strength testing, and longer-term outcome studies with sensitive instruments."," No, the study indicates that preservation of the rectus femoris origin during periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) does not compromise acetabular reorientation.

Do morbidity of early spine surgery in the multiply injured patient?,"['The optimal timing of surgery for multiply injured patients with operative spinal injuries remains unknown. The purported benefits of early intervention must be weighed against the morbidity of surgery in the early post-injury period. The performance of spine surgery in the Afghanistan theater permits analysis of the morbidity of early surgery on military casualties. The objective is to compare surgical morbidity of early spinal surgery in multiply injured patients versus stable patients. Patients were retrospectively categorized as stable or borderline unstable depending on the presence of at least one of the following: ISS >40, ISS >20 and chest injury, exploratory laparotomy or thoracotomy, lactate >2.5 mEq/L, platelet <110,000/mm(3), or >10 U PRBCs transfused pre-operatively.

Does iL-12 regulate B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signalling?,"['B7-H1, a co-inhibitory molecule of the B7 family, is found aberrantly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and infiltrating macrophage/dendritic-like cells, and plays a critical role in immune evasion by ovarian cancer. IL-12, an inducer of Th1 cell development, exerts immunomodulatory effects on ovarian cancer. However, whether IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in human ovarian cancer associated-macrophages has not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IL-12 on the expression of B7-H1 in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages and possible mechanisms. PMA induced THP-1-derived macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) or infected with adenovirus carrying human IL-12 gene (Ad-IL-12-GFP) for 24 h, then cocultured with the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line for another 24 h. Macrophages were collected for real-time PCR and Western blot to detect the expression of B7-H1, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, supernatants were collected to assay for IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-10 by ELISA. In addition, monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ were cocultured with SKOV3 and determined for the expression of B7-H1. Furthermore, the expression of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was also evaluated after blocking NF-κB signaling. The expression of B7-H1 was significantly upregulated in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP compared with the control groups (p<0.05), accompanied by a remarkable upregulation of IFN-γ (p<0.05), a marked downregulation of IL-10 (p<0.05) and activation of NF-κB signaling. However, the upregulation of B7- H1 was inhibited by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway (p<0.05). Expression of B7-H1 was also increased (p<0.05) in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ and cocultured with SKOV3. By contrast, the expression of B7-H1 in THP-1-derived macrophages was significantly decreased when treated in the same way as monocyte-derived macrophages (p<0.05), and IL-10 was also significantly decreased but IFN-γ was almost absent.']","IL-12 upregulates the expression of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages, which is possible though inducing the secretion of IFN-γ and further activating the NF-κB signal pathway. However, IL-12 downregulates the expression of B7-H1 in THP-1-derived macrophages, associated with a lack of IFN-γ and inhibition of expression of IL-10."," Yes, IL-12 appears to regulate B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages through effects on the NF-κB signaling pathway. The study indicates that treatment of monocyte-derived macrophages with IL-12 (either recombinant or via adenovirus) leads to a significant upregulation of B7-H1 expression, activation of NF-κB signaling, and alterations in the production of IFN-γ and IL-10. Furthermore, inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway was found to block the upregulation of B7-H1.

Does gene expression profiling reveal novel TGFbeta targets in adult lung fibroblasts?,"['Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), a multifunctional cytokine, plays a crucial role in the accumulation of extracellular matrix components in lung fibrosis, where lung fibroblasts are considered to play a major role. Even though the effects of TGFbeta on the gene expression of several proteins have been investigated in several lung fibroblast cell lines, the global pattern of response to this cytokine in adult lung fibroblasts is still unknown. We used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays U95v2, containing approximately 12,000 human genes, to study the transcriptional profile in response to a four hour treatment with TGFbeta in control lung fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic and scleroderma-associated pulmonary fibrosis. A combination of the Affymetrix change algorithm (Microarray Suite 5) and of analysis of variance models was used to identify TGFbeta-regulated genes. Additional criteria were an average up- or down- regulation of at least two fold. Exposure of fibroblasts to TGFbeta had a profound impact on gene expression, resulting in regulation of 129 transcripts. We focused on genes not previously found to be regulated by TGFbeta in lung fibroblasts or other cell types, including nuclear co-repressor 2, SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2), bone morphogenetic protein 4, and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), and confirmed the microarray results by real time-PCR. Western Blotting confirmed induction at the protein level of AGTR1, the most highly induced gene in both control and fibrotic lung fibroblasts among genes encoding for signal transduction molecules.

Does epinephrine prevent muscle blood flow increases after perineural injection of tetrodotoxin?,"['The local anesthetic properties of tetrodotoxin, a potent naturally occurring sodium channel blocker, have been recently reexamined. It was found that sciatic nerve block duration could be greatly increased and systemic toxicity greatly decreased if epinephrine was injected with tetrodotoxin. The mechanism that underlies epinephrine-mediated prolongation of tetrodotoxin nerve blocks is not known, but indirect evidence suggests that epinephrine may slow the clearance of tetrodotoxin from the site of injection. The authors hypothesized that tetrodotoxin causes vasodilatation at its injection site, which accelerates its systemic uptake, and that this vasodilatation is attenuated by coinjected epinephrine. The radiolabeled microsphere technique was used to measure tissue blood flow in anesthetized rats before and after perisciatic injection of tetrodotoxin alone and in combination with epinephrine. Tetrodotoxin, in a dose of 0.1 ml of a 60 microM solution, significantly increased blood flow in perisciatic muscle at the injected side compared with simultaneous contralateral control and ipsilateral preinjection baseline. Tetrodotoxin did not increase blood flow in the sciatic nerve. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented tetrodotoxin-induced increases in perisciatic muscle blood flow over time and did not alter sciatic nerve blood flow. Arterial blood pressure was maintained with this dose of tetrodotoxin, although brain blood flow decreased. Coinjection of epinephrine with tetrodotoxin prevented decreases in brain blood flow. Higher doses of tetrodotoxin produced hypotension.']",Vasoconstriction in the perisciatic muscles by epinephrine may contribute to the prolongation of tetrodotoxin-induced sciatic nerve blocks and the reduction of systemic toxicity of tetrodotoxin.," Yes, based on the provided context, epinephrine prevents an increase in muscle blood flow after perineural injection of tetrodotoxin.",1.0,0.75,0.5792266130447388

Are excessive reactive oxygen species therapeutic targets for intervertebral disc degeneration?,"['Oxidative stress has been reported to be involved in numerous human diseases, including musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis. However, the interaction between intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and oxidative stress is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the contribution of oxidative stress to IVD degeneration and the efficacy of antioxidant treatment for degenerative discs. The expression level of an oxidative stress marker, nitrotyrosine, was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. For evaluating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and oxidative stress in rat annulus fibrosus (AF) cells, flow cytometry and luciferase assay with an OKD48 construct were performed. The grade of IVD degeneration was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histological analysis. A high frequency of nitrotyrosine-positive cells was observed in rat and human degenerative discs. mRNA expression of catabolic factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was significantly induced by treatment with H2O2 or buthionine sulfoximine, whereas that of aggrecan, an important chondrogenic proteoglycan, was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors blocked the inductive effect of excessive ROS on COX-2 mRNA expression. Western blotting confirmed the phosphorylation of MAPKs in H2O2 and BSO-treated AF cells. Conversely, we showed that TNF-α induced oxidative stress with increased intracellular ROS levels in AF cells.

Seventy-one percent of these patients initially presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score > or = 14 and a 'minor' ICH. We postulated that early diagnosis of ICH and rapid anticoagulation reversal would reduce ICH progression rates and mortality. All anticoagulated patients with known or suspected head trauma were entered into the Coumadin protocol. The protocol ensured immediate triage and physician evaluation, head computed tomography (CT) scan, and fresh frozen plasma administration in patients with documented ICH. Eighty-two patients were entered into the protocol with ICH documented in 19 (23%). Sixteen of 19 patients (84%) presented with GCS > or = 14. Median international normalized ratio (INR) for treated patients with ICH was 2.7 versus 2.5 for patients without ICH (p = 0.546).

Is human degenerative valve disease associated with up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 receptor-mediated bone formation?,"['The goal of this research was to define the cellular mechanisms involved in myxomatous mitral valve disease and calcific aortic valve disease and to redefine the term degenerative valve disease in terms of an active cellular biology. ""Degenerative"" valvular heart disease is the primary cause of regurgitant and stenotic valvular lesion in the U.S. However, the signaling pathways are not known. We hypothesize that valve degeneration occurs due to an osteoblastic differentiation process mediated by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) signaling pathway to cause valve thickening. We examined human diseased valves: myxomatous mitral valves (n = 23), calcified tricuspid aortic valves (n = 27), calcified bicuspid aortic valves (n = 23), and control tissue from mitral and aortic valves (n = 40). The valves were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry for signaling markers important in osteoblast differentiation: Sox9 and Cbfa1 (transcription factors for osteoblast differentiation); Lrp5 and Wnt3 (osteoblast differentiation signaling marker), osteopontin and osteocalcin (osteoblast endochrondral bone matrix proteins), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker of cell proliferation). Cartilage development and bone formation was measured by Alcian blue stain and Alizarin red stain. Computed Scano MicroCT-40 (Bassersdorf, Switzerland) analysis measured calcium burden. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, osteocalcin, and other osteochrondrogenic differentiation markers were increased in the calcified aortic valves by protein and gene expression (p > 0.001).

Is the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene required for the alpha1L-adrenoceptor-mediated response in isolated preparations of the mouse prostate?,"['This study investigated whether deletion of the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene influences contractile responses of mouse prostate to noradrenaline. Responses of mouse prostate to noradrenaline are known to be mediated by alpha1L-adrenoceptors, which are thought to be a functional phenotype of alpha1A-adrenoceptor. Prostate tissues from alpha1A-adrenoceptor knockout mice which were homozygous (alpha1A -/-) and heterozygous (alpha1A +/-) for the disrupted alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene, as well as wild-type (alpha1A +/+) littermates were mounted in glass-isolated organ baths. Electrical field stimulation of nerves and exogenous application of noradrenaline were used to investigate the effects of alpha1A-adrenoceptor disruption on prostate contractility. Frequency-response curves to electrical field stimulation (0.5 ms pulse duration, 60 V, 0.1-20 Hz) yielded frequency-dependent contractions. At frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz, prostates from alpha1A -/- mice elicited an approximately 30% decreased response compared with prostates from alpha(1A)+/+ mice. Prazosin (0.3 muM) attenuated responses to electrical field stimulation in prostates from alpha1A +/+ and alpha1A +/- mice but not from alpha1A -/- mice. Increasing concentrations of exogenously administered noradrenaline (10 nM-1 mM) produced mean concentration-response curves in prostates from alpha1A +/+ and alpha1A +/- mice, which were not different. Maximum responses to noradrenaline were decreased by approximately 80% in prostates from alpha1A -/- mice compared with alpha1A +/+ mice. Prazosin attenuated responses to noradrenaline in all genotypes.']","alpha1L-Adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mouse prostate are abolished in alpha1A -/- mice, demonstrating that the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene is essential to the manifestation of the prostatic alpha1L-adrenoceptor phenotype. This implies that alpha1L-adrenoceptors are indeed a functional phenotype of alpha1A-adrenoceptor."," Yes, it appears that the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene is required to a certain extent for the alpha1L-adrenoceptor-mediated response in isolated preparations of the mouse prostate. The study shows that the contractility response to noradrenaline, mediated by alpha1L-adrenoceptors, is decreased in prostates from alpha1A -/- mice compared to wild-type and heterozygous mice. Furthermore, prazosin, an antagonist for both alpha1A and alpha1L adrenoreceptors, attenuated responses to noradrenaline in all genotypes except the homozygous knockout mice.

Does glucose modulate event-related potential components of recollection and familiarity in healthy adolescents?,"['Behavioural evidence supports the notion that oral glucose ingestion enhances recognition memory judgements based on recollection, but not familiarity. The present study sought to clarify and extend upon these behavioural findings by investigating the influence of glucose administration on event-related potential (ERP) components that are thought to be differentially mediated by recollection and familiarity processes in healthy adolescents. In a within-subjects design, participants performed a recognition memory task, during which time electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, subsequent to ingestion of either (a) glucose or (b) placebo in a counterbalanced order. Response times during the recognition memory task were observed to be faster for the glucose condition, relative to a placebo control. Further, glucose ingestion was associated with an enhanced left parietal old/new ERP effect (a marker of recollection) and an enhanced mid-frontal old/new ERP effect (known to be mediated by familiarity).']","These findings (a) support the results of previous research that the 'glucose memory facilitation effect' can be extended to healthy adolescents, but (b) suggest that glucose enhances both the recollection and familiarity components of recognition memory. The observed ERP profile has important implications for the proposal that glucose specifically targets the hippocampus in modulating cognitive performance."," Yes, according to the provided context, glucose ingestion does modulate event-related potential (ERP) components that are thought to be differentially mediated by recollection and familiarity processes in healthy adolescents.

Does plasmin induce endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary artery?,"['Plasmin is a key enzyme in fibrinolysis. We attempted to determine the possible role of plasmin in the regulation of vascular tone, while also investigating the mechanism of plasmin-induced vasorelaxation. In porcine coronary artery, plasmin induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation. This relaxing effect was mostly abolished by a proteinase inhibitor, a plasmin inhibitor, or a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor. The preceding stimulation with plasmin significantly inhibited the subsequent relaxation induced by thrombin but not that induced by proteinase-activated receptor-1-activating peptide. The relaxation induced by trypsin and substance P remained unaffected by the preceding plasmin stimulation. The pretreatment with plasmin, thrombin, or trypsin significantly attenuated the plasmin-induced relaxation. In porcine coronary artery endothelial cells (PCAECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), plasmin induced a transient elevation in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The preceding stimulation with plasmin inhibited the subsequent [Ca2+]i elevation induced by thrombin but not that induced by trypsin. In PCAECs, plasmin concentration-dependently induced NO production.']","The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that plasmin induced an endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary artery, while also showing plasmin to specifically inactivate the thrombin receptor."," The provided context does not contain information about plasmin's role in inducing endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary artery.

Does caveolin-1 play a critical role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages?,"['Monocyte to macrophage differentiation is an essential step in atherogenesis. The structure protein of caveolae, caveolin-1, is increased in primary monocytes after its adhesion to endothelium. We explore the hypothesis that caveolin-1 plays a role in monocyte differentiation to macrophages. Both phorbol myristate acetate-induced THP-1 and colony-stimulating factor-induced primary monocyte differentiation was associated with an increase in cellular caveolin-1 expression. Overexpression of caveolin-1 by transfection increased macrophage surface markers and inflammatory genes, whereas caveolin-1 knockdown by small interfering RNA or knockout reduced these. Also, caveolin-1 knockdown inhibited the differentiation-induced nuclear translocation of early growth response 1 (EGR-1) through extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, further decreased the binding of EGR-1 to CD115 promoter, thus decreasing EGR-1 transcriptional activity. In functional assays, caveolin-1 inhibited transmigration but promoted phagocytosis in the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Decreasing caveolin-1 inhibited the uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein and reduced cellular lipid content. Finally, we showed that caveolin-1 knockout mice displayed less monocyte differentiation than wild-type mice and that EGR-1 transcription activity was also decreased in these mice because of the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation.']","Caveolin-1 promotes monocyte to macrophage differentiation through the regulation of EGR-1 transcriptional activity, suggesting that phagocytic caveolin-1 may be critical for atherogenesis."," Yes, the context suggests that caveolin-1 does play a critical role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. Overexpression of caveolin-1 increased macrophage surface markers and inflammatory genes, while its knockdown or knockout decreased these, indicating an important role in the process. Additionally, caveolin-1 has been shown to influence various aspects of monocyte-macrophage lineage function, such as transendothelial migration, phagocytosis, lipid uptake, and nuclear translocation of key proteins involved in differentiation.",1.0,1.0,0.8056355118751526
Do eye movements reveal impaired inhibitory control in adult male fragile X premutation carriers asymptomatic for FXTAS?,"['Fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) have an expansion of 55-200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Male fXPCs are at risk for developing a neurodegenerative motor disorder (FXTAS) often accompanied by inhibitory control impairments, even in fXPCs without motor symptoms. Inhibitory control impairments might precede, and thus indicate elevated risk for motor impairment associated with FXTAS. We tested whether inhibitory impairments are observable in fXPCs by assessing oculomotor performance. Participants were males aged 18-48 years asymptomatic for FXTAS. FXPCs (n = 21) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 22) performed four oculomotor tasks. In a Fixation task, participants fixated on a central cross and maintained gaze position when a peripheral stimulus appeared. In a Pursuit task, participants maintained gaze on a square moving at constant velocity. In a Prosaccade task, participants fixated on a central cross, then looked at a peripheral stimulus. An Antisaccade task was identical to the Prosaccade task, except participants looked in the direction opposite the stimulus. Inhibitory cost was the difference in saccade latency between the Antisaccade and Prosaccade tasks. Relative to controls, fXPCs had longer saccade latency in the Antisaccade task. In fXPCs, inhibitory cost was positively associated with vermis area in lobules VI-VII.']","Antisaccades require inhibitory control to inhibit reflexive eye movements. We found that eye movements are sensitive to impaired inhibitory control in fXPCs asymptomatic for FXTAS. Thus, eye movements may be useful in assessing FXTAS risk or disease progression."," Yes, eye movements reveal impaired inhibitory control in adult male Fragile X premutation carriers asymptomatic for FXTAS.

Is the Jarvik 2000 associated with less infections than the HeartMate left ventricular assist device?,"['Device-related infections remain a considerable problem of left-ventricular support. We compared the device-related-infections between the HeartMate left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the Jarvik 2000 permanent LVAD, a device with a novel retroauricular power-supply. Between December 2000 and September 2002 we implanted the HeartMate-vented, electrical-system in 11 patients and the permanent Jarvik 2000 in six patients. Total support time was 1626 patient-days (HeartMate, 26-271 days) versus 1246 patient-days (Jarvik 2000, 8-411 days). As potential risk factors for infection we analyzed age, preoperative hospital-days, total protein, cardiac index, maximal oxygen uptake, use of inotropes, LVAD risk-score-index and Aaronson-Mancini-score, intubation time, and intensive care unit stay. We used the Center of Disease Control definitions for surgical site infections. HeartMate-patients were younger than Jarvik 2000 patients (46+/-13 versus 58+/-6 years, P=0.056), there were no other differences in the risk factors. Four HeartMate-patients needed late (>or=48 h) surgical revisions for bleeding/hematomas versus no revisions in the Jarvik 2000 patients.

Does retrograde coronary vein infusion of cardiac explant-derived c-Kit+ cells improves function in ischemic heart failure?,"['Progenitor cells isolated from cardiac explant-derived cells improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI). To fully realize the therapeutic potential of these cells, it is essential to develop a safe and efficient delivery method. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of our newly developed approach to retrograde coronary vein (RCV) infusion of cardiac c-Kit(+) cells in a small-animal model of congestive heart failure (CHF). Sprague-Dawley rats underwent experimental MI. After 21 days, cardiac explant-derived c-Kit(+) cells were delivered to both sham and CHF animals using RCV delivery. Vehicle-treated (serum-free medium) sham and CHF animals were used as controls. Cardiac function and heart tissues were evaluated 21 days post-transplantation. RCV-delivered cells were retained in infarcted hearts for at least 21 days after transplantation. At 21 days post-RCV infusion, the majority of transplanted c-Kit(+)/GFP(+) cells were localized in the left ventricle. Compared with vehicle-treated CHF animals, RCV-treated rats showed a significant improvement in cardiac function. Furthermore, RCV-treated rats exhibited an increase in capillary density, a decrease in total heart collagen, and a reduction in both infarct size and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy when compared with vehicle-treated CHF rats.']","Our study showed that the RCV infusion approach is an efficient technique for targeted cell delivery to the infarcted myocardium.
